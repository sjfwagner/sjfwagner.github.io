#### One listener knows not what he says.

A few notes: Throughout this post I will assume that women and men are equal in capabilities and unequal in opportunities. Opportunity is highly dependent on many things in society, including religion, skin color, socioeconomic status, and (as examined here) gender; whereas capability is not.

Additionally, this post will describe gender overall as a binary male and female -- despite the fact that this demonstrably false and that gender exists on a spectrum. This post will therefore exclude transgender and non-binary persons. This is for a few reasons, first) the data I have that way compiled by outside sources does not include such considerations and most analysis requires the data to comparable (a line I am already stretching) second) for most of history non-binary and transgender individuals were not recognized (with a few notable exceptions) by their societies. It is best to assume that by male and female in this post, I refer to sex. In every other way I will strive to be as inclusive as possible, but please feel free to comment if I have missed anybody, my intention is to learn as much as possible.

“Stuff You Missed in History Class” is a delightfully educational podcast by Tracy B. Wilson and Holly Fry of “How Stuff Works.” It’s purpose is to provide an overview of historical people and events that you may have missed in in your history class either because they weren’t taught, or they were underexamined. They are deservingly popular and readers often write in to suggest topics or provide comments on recent episodes and interesting pieces of this listener mail are read aloud to the general audience during the “Listener Mail” section of the podcast. I was shocked to listen, some months ago in [their episode on Liszt](http://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts/lisztomania/ "SYMIH"), to a listener Ross who wrote to the women thus: 

> “[In your episode about Calamity Jane] you complained about the man who gave you a one star review 
> because he said that you had too many episodes about women. I have two comments about your
> discussion about this. One, you said that you only have 5 episodes about women in the last
> twenty and therefore you were not doing enough episodes about women, while the 5 number is true
> it is also unrepresentative because in those twenty you had a number of episodes that were about
> neither men nor women -- like peanut butter and hippos -- I count exactly five episodes about
> men. More importantly I would have guessed that you had too many episodes about women too; the
> reason for this is that **when you guys do episodes about women you lose all objectivity**, for
> men you present facts, for women you celebrate her life, get excited, and offer commentary about
> how much you love her. This makes these episodes much more noticeable and for that reason I
> sometimes skip your episodes that are likely to be like that. In other words **episodes about**
> **men are history** while **episodes about women become a story** and all event. I would agree
> with the commentator that you discussed, although certainly not the 1-star review. And suggest
> that either episodes about men should be more exciting to you or you should become more
> objective when you discuss women, and **you should certainly not do even more episodes about**
> **women when the ratio of men to women in the twenty episodes that you chose was one-to-one.**”

Holly and Tracy refuted him far more politely than he deserved, but the accusation has been burning in my mind for the last few months.  They mostly refute some of the listener’s comments by clarifying the 20 episode sample they examined and by saying that they were equally excited about men and they were about women (something I certainly believe). They also brought up a really important note on the perception of the equality of genders, namely that in media a crowd with 30% women will be evaluated by viewers as containing 50% women, and a real ratio of 50% will be perceived as much higher (something that extends beyond media).  I believe this listener’s misguided request points to a larger societal problem about the visibility and treatment of women, and how we teach history in this country. Below is my examination of Gender Bias in “Stuff you missed in History Class.” I’ll be investigating a few key questions from the reader’s comment, as well as those implied. 

## ** _Men & Women: Who gets episodes on Stuff You Missed in History Class?_ ** 

I have classified each podcast throughout Stuff You Missed in History Class’s history into 8 categories, two major categories (‘Loose’, & ‘Tight’) and four subcategories (‘Male’,’Female’,’Neutral’, and ‘Both’). 

- Loose - this is a general or colloquial understanding, where labels are applied more liberally. For instance, if a podcast on the Titanic mostly describes the men who designed, built, and crashed her, it would be coded as ‘Male’
	- Male - podcast is explicitly about men or covers mostly male achievements
    - Female - podcast is explicitly about women or covers mostly female achievements
    - Neutral - podcast is about an place, thing, or event that is not about either male or female achievement
    - Both - podcast is about both men and women, roughly equally
- Tight - this is a strict understanding, where labels are placed according to the topic of the podcast, and gender only for explicitly male or female topics, all others neutral or both
	- Male - podcast is explicitly about men
    - Female - podcast is explicitly about women
    - Neutral - podcast is about an place, thing, or event that is not about either male or female achievement
    - Both - podcast is about both men and women, roughly equally

Using these categories, I have classified the nearly 900 podcasts since 2008. I have tried to be objective, but there will be a level of error introduced where a particular person may agree or disagree with me on my subjective determinations. 

### _Men & Women in SYMIH’s episode archive_

I used the archive provided at their website, and the descriptions at the episode’s profile (using some light webscraping, the script for which can be found here), to collect the title, date published, and the synopsis of the episode. After collecting this into a single google sheet, I used the synopsis or listened to the episode where necessary, to determine the Gender (as described in the previous section) for each the nearly 1,000 episodes (DAMN LADIES).
